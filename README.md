Chaotic Drone Eurorack Module
This project aims to the exploration of chaotic systems in sound design by developing a Eurorack module focused on rich, evolving drone textures. Inspired by nonlinear dynamics, feedback networks, and unpredictability, Drone_Chaos creates organic, unstable tones ideal for ambient, noise, and experimental music.
